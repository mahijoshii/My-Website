    <p id="IntroTxt">Hello, Iâ€™m a high school student and STEM enthusiast. As the president and founder of a STEM Club, I believe in helping underrepresented groups find their passion in STEM related subjects and careers. I currently work as a web manager, as well as a dance teacher. On this website, you can learn more about my projects, work experience, and career goals.</p>

   <p> STEM is my passion for many reasons. STEM teaches students to define problems, conduct background research, develop multiple ideas for solutions, develop and create a prototype, and then test, evaluate, and redesign them. Students that study STEM gain a thorough awareness of the world around them. Young people can work in a world full of high-tech advances thanks to technology.</p>

    <p id="LastText">As a young developer, I know that our digital world is run by code. Code is necessary for the operation of every website, mobile app, computer software, calculator, and even microwave. Thus, programmers are the digital age's architects and builders. Coding is our future and a skill individuals should learn.</p>
