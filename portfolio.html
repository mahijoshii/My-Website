    <p class="PortTEXT">A hackathon is any event of any duration where people come together to solve problems.Your knowledge, skill level, good programming abilities, and excellent experience working in demanding conditions all enhance as you participate in a hackathon.At the Odyssey hackathon, my team was challenged to create an application which battled climate change. We created "GO Pool", a carpooling app whose aim was to reduce carbon dioxide and methane emisions from the transportation industry.</p>

    <p>At the University of Waterloo Catalyst Women in Engineering conference I was able to meet like-minded girls who share the same interests in STEM as me. Throughout the conference I was able to participate in fun activities, meet engineering students, and attend lectures!</p>
        <p class="PortTEXT">We were challenged to design a wearable, walkable boot that could withstand burning water. Here is what my team created:</p>
    <img class= "PortfolioImages" src="images/boots.JPG" alt="White boots made out of various plastic materials. These boots are bulky and quite large. The boots are decorated with drawn images of fire, stars, and mars in red and black. The words 'Lava-proof astronaut boots, Christmas edition' are also written on the boots in black marker.">

    <p id="PortText">As a woman, I was never encouraged to pursue a career in engineering, until I went to an engineering conference for women at the University of Waterloo. From this event, I became inspired to pursue a career in STEM, and I also wanted to encourage other youth as well. I’ve always wanted to start a STEM club, but I didn’t know where to begin. My school seemed like a great place to start because I have a lot of resources and adults willing to help. I was so excited to start the club. Around 60 students in my school wanted to join the club and further their knowledge in STEM by joining me for some hands-on activities. I was blown away by the response. It felt like I had accomplished so much in such a short time, and I was so proud to be the founder of this club. For the upcoming school year, I have big plans as I intend to hold meetings with the female empowerment club, and the ABC club to encourage females and black youth to pursue STEM. I am planning to enroll in competitions, host STEM related events, and even have guest speakers talk to the students.</p>
